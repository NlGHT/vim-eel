# vim-eel2

**_Actual_** REAPER ReaScript EEL2 syntax highlighting for vim. No C fluff.

## Installation
Add this to your plugin manager like such:

For latest development version (mine):
```vim
Plug 'NlGHT/vim-eel2'
```

Upstream (and perhaps more stable but may be missing some features):
```vim
Plug 'TristanCrawford/vim-eel2'
```
